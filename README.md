Project 4 for Frontend Nanodegree. Summary of Optimizations made on code and images. Website was finalized with GulpJs.

Live version

Final Build copy can be found on this projects build directory

Optimization Changes

Changes made in files are usually commented.
Part 1 - 
Removed webfont to reduce page load time.

In-lined CSS in Head.

Moved googleanalytics to its own js file within js directory. Added async tag.

Mobile - 92 / 100Speed
Desktop - 93 / 100

Part 2 -

Required the following plugins:
gulp-uglifycss - minimize css files
gulp-uncss - remove unused boostrap styles from pizza.html
gulp-image-optimization - optimize images for web
gulp-minify-inline - minify inline css and scripts
gulp-minify-html - minify html pages
gulp-uglify - minimize js files

Inlined all style sheets Created local copies of images and thumbnails, resized images too large 
Made script calls async 

container

Optimized random pizza appending loop Moved randomPizza reference outside of loop.

Optimized function updatePositions() Storing all moving pizzas in var items outside of function

Optimized document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {}

***********************************
Original README Content:
Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).
To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.
